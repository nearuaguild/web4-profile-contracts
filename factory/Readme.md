<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

ðŸ’¡ _Before starting, please ensure that you have all the necessary installations completed_

- [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo#compiling-from-source)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git/)
- [Near CLI](https://docs.near.org/tools/near-cli#setup)

### Installation

Follow these simple instructions to set up a local development environment

1. Clone the repo
  ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/nearuaguild/web4-profile-contracts.git
  ```
2. Open project folder
  ```sh
  cd web4-profile-contracts/factory
  ```
3. Compile Smart Contracts
  ```sh
  ./build.sh
  ```
4. Create Factory subaccount (replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT` with your own account name)
  ```sh
  NODE_ENV=mainnet near create-account page_factory.YOUR_ACCOUNT.near --masterAccount YOUR_ACCOUNT.near --initialBalance 2
  ```
5. Deploy
  ```sh
  NODE_ENV=mainnet near deploy CONTRACT_NAME=page_factory.YOUR_ACCOUNT.near ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/factory.wasm
  ```
6. Initialize contract
  ```sh
  NODE_ENV=mainnet near call page_factory.YOUR_ACCOUNT.near new '{}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.near
  ```
7. Set IPFS Gateway url for static files from Web4 Profile Contract
  ```sh
  NODE_ENV=mainnet near call page_factory.YOUR_ACCOUNT.near set_ipfs '{"ipfs": "ipfs://bafybeihiw6mwe63nvy6it7sialrr3fgx57jqnfdqlpxg7do6fytbxnzmna"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.near
  ```
8. Store Web4 Profile WASM bytes inside Factory Contract
  ```sh
  CONTRACT_BYTES=`cat ./res/contract.wasm | base64`
  ```
  ```sh
  NODE_ENV=mainnet near call page_factory.YOUR_ACCOUNT.near set_code "$CONTRACT_BYTES" --base64 --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT.near
  ```

## Usage

You can easily create your site with a single function call

To gain ownership of your created Web4 account, you need to replace `YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY` with your own public key from the FullAccess key pair

For instance, my public key is `ed25519:8W9CiyPPehz2GRW8AYho9nx1z1GLdeZQCyn2wqYgJjiG`

```sh
NODE_ENV=mainnet near call page_factory.YOUR_ACCOUNT.near create_web4_little_link_page '{"page_data":{"title":"Near Ukraine Guild","description":"Fast-growing guild based in Ukraine, aimed at providing high-quality educational content and assistance to grow a strong community of developers/entrepreneurs/enthusiasts within the Near Protocol ecosystem", "links":[{
      "type": 0,
      "text": "Medium",
      "path": "@nearuaguild"
    },{
      "type": 1,
      "text": "Twitter",
      "path": "nearuaguild"
    },{
      "type": 2,
      "text": "Telegram",
      "path": "nearprotocoluachannel"
    },{
      "type": 3,
      "text": "GitHub",
      "path": "nearuaguild"
    }]}, "pub_key": "YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"}' --accountId denbite.testnet --deposit 0.7 --gas 300000000000000
```

The function will provide the address of the deployed contract, which will look like `d5f6574f11d34497671dee4e.near`

You can then access the site at https://d5f6574f11d34497671dee4e.near.page by replacing the address with the account that was created for you
